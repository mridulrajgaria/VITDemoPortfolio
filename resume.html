            <h3>Brain Tumor Detection System</h3>
            <p>
              Built a comprehensive medical image classification system using a custom ResNet architecture to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. The model was trained on annotated datasets with high precision, achieving improved classification accuracy through data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques. To enhance usability, the system was integrated with a conversational chatbot using the Gemini API, allowing patients or medical staff to interact with the system via natural language queries. This combination of AI-driven diagnostics and an accessible interface demonstrates the potential for real-world clinical deployment and early detection support.

            <img src="images/project-spartanplays.jpg" alt="SpartanPlays Cybersecurity Quiz" />
            <h3>SpartanPlays – Cyber Security Awareness Quiz</h3>
            <p>
              Developed an interactive, gamified quiz platform targeting cybersecurity awareness in underrepresented and rural areas. The platform was designed with accessibility in mind, featuring a clean UI, local language support, and mobile-first responsiveness. Topics included phishing, password safety, online privacy, and social engineering. Conducted offline awareness campaigns in collaboration with local authorities, where the quiz was accessed via QR codes. The initiative led to a 40% increase in participant engagement and reduced misconceptions about basic digital threats by 30%, as measured through post-event surveys.

          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/project-covid-nlp.jpg" alt="COVID Sentiment Insights" />
            <h3>COVID Sentiment Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Conducted large-scale sentiment analysis on Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic using advanced NLP pipelines. Employed transformer-based models like BERT and RoBERTa fine-tuned for emotion classification, enabling accurate recognition of fear, hope, skepticism, and frustration in public discourse. The system achieved 85% accuracy in multi-label sentiment prediction. Results were visualized through dynamic dashboards to highlight public sentiment trends over time and geography. This project provides valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials to understand and respond to community concerns in real-time.
